# Finnish Civil War Discourse Analysis Using NLP Techniques

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the discourse surrounding the Finnish Civil War in Finnish parliamentary speeches. This is a part of the final project of the course 'Statistical natural language processing for social science, COS-D441'

### Background 

"On December 6th 1917 the Grand Duchy of Finland declared independence, becoming the first nation to independently secede from the corpse of the Russian Empire and the embryo that was to become the Soviet Union. Just fifty-three days later on the night of January 27th 1918, Finland erupted into a brutal civil war. Two opposing movements had polarized the Finnish people to the breaking point. For the next three and a half months, the Finnish people tore their nation apart in a conflict that would claim the lives of 36,000 people, out of a total population of just 3 million "(Maavara Alexander, Finland Divided: The Finnish Civil War 1918.
